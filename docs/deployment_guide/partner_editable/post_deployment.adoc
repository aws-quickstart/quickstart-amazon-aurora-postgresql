=== Test the deployment

*Note* This optional test procedure assumes that you have the *bastion host* access with *TCPForwarding* capabilities.

. Download the latest version of https://www.pgadmin.org/download/[pgAdmin 4] and install it on your workstation from where you will be connecting to the Aurora PostgreSQL DB cluster.
. From the AWS CloudFormation console, on the *Outputs* tab for BastionStack, note the value for EIP1, as shown in Figure 3.

. From the AWS CloudFormation console, on the *Outputs* tab for AuroraStack__,__ note the values of DBName, DBMasterUsername, RDSEndpointAddress**,** and RDSEndpointPort, as shown in Figure 4.

. Create an SSH tunnel to the bastion host using the following command.

ssh -N -L <RDSEndpointPort>:<RDSEndPointAddress>:<RDSEndpointPort> ec2-user@EIP1 -i <KeyPairName>

*Note* You will need to enter the path for the EC2 key pair that you specified for *Key name* (KeyPairName) parameter while creating the CloudFormation stack. When youâ€™re finished testing, terminate the SSH tunnel by pressing Ctrl+C.

With the values added, the command will look like the following.

ssh -N -L 5432:amazonaurorapostgres-aurorastack-auroradbcluster-13ikqqfuz14ut.cluster-cqkx5uin33n9.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:5432 ec2-user@35.166.99.4 -i keypair.pem

. Launch *PgAdmin 4* on your workstation, enter a new password, and choose *OK* to continue.

. Choose the *Connection* tab, and provide the following values.

* In the *Host name/address* field, enter 127.0.0.1.
* In the *Maintenance database* field, enter the <DBName>.
* In the *Username* field, enter the <DBMasterUsername>.

These values can be found on the *Outputs* tab of the Aurora stack. See Figure 4.

* In the *Password* field, enter the <DBMasterUserPassword> you entered during stack creation.

. Choose *Save* to store the connection information and to connect.
