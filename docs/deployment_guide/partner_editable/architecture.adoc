.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/image1.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the public subnets, an optional Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure Shell (SSH) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets, an Aurora DB cluster that includes two DB readers and one DB writer.
* An encryption key using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). The Quick Start uses the key to enable encryption at rest for the Aurora DB cluster.
* An Amazon CloudWatch alarm to monitor the CPU on the bastion host and send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) notification when the alarm is triggered.

[.small]#* The template that deploys this Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
